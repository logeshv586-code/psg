It is installed in the return line of the equipment, where the flow is adjusted to match the design specifications by manipulating the valve spindle. Initially, the pressure drop across the coil is measured, and the valve spindle is adjusted to achieve the desired flow rate. Modern advancements in flow measurement, such as ultrasound manometers, facilitate easier flow balancing by providing real-time readings during valve adjustment. A notable advancement in double regulating valves is the pressure-independent control valve. This type of valve ensures precise flow control with each spindle turn and can modulate onset temperature as well as shut off the flow to the system. This innovation eliminates the need for separate balancing valves and two- or three-way control valves, streamlining system design and improving efficiency. Fixed Orifice - DZR Brass Variable Orifice - DZR Brass Double Regulating Value - Cast iron PRESSURE INDEPENDENT CONTROL VALVES The Pressure Independent Control Valve (PICV) is a combined flow limiter and temperature control valve, designed for both variable and constant temperature systems. It functions as a constant flow limiter in constant volume systems or as a true PICV in variable volume systems, offering precise flow and temperature control. PICVs integrate an automatic temperature control valve with an automatic flow regulating valve, maintaining a constant flow of hot or chilled water regardless of pressure changes. These valves eliminate the need for system balancing during commissioning, ensuring consistent flow to coils as pressure fluctuates, improving comfort, energy efficiency, and reducing maintenance costs. The valves automatic flow regulation ensures that each coil receives the correct flow, preventing inefficient performance or energy waste. By balancing the flow within ±10% of the design flow, PICVs optimize system performance, reduce pumping energy, and eliminate hot and cold spots in buildings. The differential pressure regulator, which includes a rubber diaphragm, adjusts to pressure changes to maintain a constant pressure drop across the valve, ensuring optimal system efficiency. Linear Characteristic PICV Equal Percentage Characteristic PICV Ductile Iron PICV DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE To address the increasing use of variable speed pumps in HVAC applications, we have introduced a range of Differential Pressure Control Valves (DPCV) designed to optimize system performance. The DPCV is set to a maximum differential pressure, ensuring that the flow does not exceed the desired rate, thereby reducing energy consumption, minimizing noise, and simplifying the commissioning process.

HVAC, which stands for Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning, encompasses a range of systems designed to maintain optimal indoor conditions, from residential air conditioners to large-scale systems used in industrial complexes and high-rise buildings. A well-designed HVAC system aims to provide thermal comfort and regulate indoor environments by applying the principles of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Common examples include the large air conditioning units typically found on the rooftops of apartment buildings or office complexes. HVAC systems are essential in large-scale environments such as industrial buildings, skyscrapers, and apartment blocks, as well as in spaces where temperature and humidity must be carefully controlled to meet regulatory standards. These systems are also vital in commercial and residential settings, where they provide heating, cooling, and air quality control. An HVAC system controls its environment by regulating room temperature and humidity levels, ensuring proper air distribution, and maintaining indoor air cleanliness. The technology of HVAC is focused on ensuring indoor environmental comfort, aiming to deliver thermal comfort and acceptable indoor air quality. We offer a wide range of HVAC products tailored to meet the needs of residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, including hotels, shopping malls, schools, office buildings, and more GATE VALVE Gate valves are bi-directional, multi-purpose valves, available in a variety of materials such as brass, lead-free brass, bronze, and cast iron, with options for either rising or non-rising stems. These valves are widely used in residential and commercial buildings for a range of services, including hot and cold water, HVAC systems, steam, compressed air, gas, and other general utility applications. Gate valves are primarily designed to initiate or stop the flow of fluid and are ideal when a straight-line flow with minimal restriction is required. During operation, these valves are typically either fully open or fully closed. When fully open, the valve&#39;s disk is completely retracted into the bonnet, creating an unobstructed opening that matches the internal diameter of the connected piping system. This design ensures efficient flow with minimal resistance. Gate valves are suitable for a broad range of liquids and provide a secure, tight seal when closed. Non rising Stem- lead free brass Non rising stem - brass non rising stem - brass lockshield - brass rising stem - cast iron non rising stem cast iron BUTTERFLY VALVES Butterfly valves are bi-directional, quick shut-off valves available in lug, wafer, or double- flanged types, suitable for residential and commercial applications. They operate with a quarter-turn motion, allowing for easy and fast flow control. A 90-degree rotation of the handle fully opens or closes the valve. Larger valves may include a gearbox for easier operation. These valves are efficient, cost-effective, and require minimal maintenance due to fewer moving parts. They are ideal for handling large volumes of liquids, gases, and slurries. The flow control element, a disc, rotates on an axis, with flow stoppage achieved by sealing against the valve seat. Butterfly valves offer advantages over other valve types, such as weight and space savings, and are well-suited for low-pressure systems. lug type water type flanged type centric - butterfly valves (lug or water style) double eccentric - butterfly valves BALL VALVES Ball valves are quarter-turn shut-off valves made from materials like brass, bronze, lead-free brass, cast iron, and stainless steel. They control the flow of liquids or gases by rotating a ball with a bore 90 degrees to either allow or block flow. Known for their long lifespan and reliable sealing, they are more popular than gate valves for shut-off applications and are resistant to contaminated media. While less common as control valves, they can still regulate flow, though less accurately than other control valves. Ball valves come in two, three, or four-port designs and are typically manually operated. Common materials include chrome-plated steel, brass, stainless steel, and PVC. Brass valves are widely used but may suffer from dezincification when exposed to chloride solutions. Bronze ball valve brass ball valve dzr brass ball valve cast iron ball valve ductile iron ball valve CHECK VALVES A check valve, or non-return valve, allows fluid to flow in only one direction, preventing backflow. Made from materials like bronze, brass, cast iron, and ductile iron, check valves open with fluid pressure and close automatically when flow reverses. Common in piping systems, especially in pump and compressor discharge lines, check valves are available in swing, lift, wafer, and globe types for commercial, industrial, and HVAC applications. Swing check valves feature an unguided disc that fully opens or closes based on flow, while lift check valves are used in high-pressure services. Dual check valves, which are lightweight and compact, are commonly used in low-pressure systems and offer easy installation and maintenance. Swing check valve - lead free brass lift check valve - brass swing check valve - brass swing check valve - bronze swing check valve - cast iron dual plate check valve - cast iron silent check valve - cast iron lift check valve - bronze dual plate check valve nozzle type - check valve (non slam check valve) STRAINERS Strainers are key components used to protect valves, pumps, and other equipment by filtering unwanted particles from fluids. Installed upstream, they prevent contaminants from damaging critical systems. Common types include Y-type and Basket-type strainers, available in various materials and configurations. These strainers use removable screens to filter particles as small as 0.001 inches and can separate reusable materials. Strainers are used in industries like chemical, food, water, petroleum, and paint, typically found before equipment such as pumps, valves, and filters. Y-strainers remove solids from liquids, gases, or steam and are manually cleaned when needed. Basket strainers are designed for high-flow liquid applications and can be serviced by removing the cover to access the basket. Duplex Basket Strainers allow uninterrupted flow while one basket is serviced. Y Type Strainers- brass Y Type - DSR Bronze Y Type Strainers - Bronze Y Type Strainers - Cast Iron Basket Type strainers - cast iron FLEXIBLE JOINTS Flexible connectors are vital for piping systems, offering flexibility to absorb noise, vibration, and thermal expansion while allowing movement. These connectors minimize stress and forces, ensuring reliable operation and isolating vibrations from mechanical equipment. Expansion joints, ideal for absorbing thermal expansion or movement where expansion loops are impractical, provide stress relief and compensate for lateral, torsional, and angular movements. Rubber expansion joints, reinforced with metallic fabrics, prevent damage and downtime. Tied flanged connectors reduce noise and vibration transmission in systems where rubber connectors are unsuitable. Made from stainless steel with carbon steel flanges, these connectors are used in various industries, including HVAC, air compressors, plumbing, pumps, chemical factories, and marine applications. Flexibale Connection Rubber Expension Joints Tied Flanged DOUBLE REGULATING VALVES A double regulating valve, also known as a balancing valve, is primarily used to control and balance the water flow in chilled water air conditioning systems. It is installed in the return line of the equipment, where the flow is adjusted to match the design specifications by manipulating the valve spindle. Initially, the pressure drop across the coil is measured, and the valve spindle is adjusted to achieve the desired flow rate. Modern advancements in flow measurement, such as ultrasound manometers, facilitate easier flow balancing by providing real-time readings during valve adjustment. A notable advancement in double regulating valves is the pressure-independent control valve. This type of valve ensures precise flow control with each spindle turn and can modulate onset temperature as well as shut off the flow to the system. This innovation eliminates the need for separate balancing valves and two- or three-way control valves, streamlining system design and improving efficiency. Fixed Orifice - DZR Brass Variable Orifice - DZR Brass Double Regulating Value - Cast iron PRESSURE INDEPENDENT CONTROL VALVES The Pressure Independent Control Valve (PICV) is a combined flow limiter and temperature control valve, designed for both variable and constant temperature systems. It functions as a constant flow limiter in constant volume systems or as a true PICV in variable volume systems, offering precise flow and temperature control. PICVs integrate an automatic temperature control valve with an automatic flow regulating valve, maintaining a constant flow of hot or chilled water regardless of pressure changes. These valves eliminate the need for system balancing during commissioning, ensuring consistent flow to coils as pressure fluctuates, improving comfort, energy efficiency, and reducing maintenance costs. The valves automatic flow regulation ensures that each coil receives the correct flow, preventing inefficient performance or energy waste. By balancing the flow within ±10% of the design flow, PICVs optimize system performance, reduce pumping energy, and eliminate hot and cold spots in buildings. The differential pressure regulator, which includes a rubber diaphragm, adjusts to pressure changes to maintain a constant pressure drop across the valve, ensuring optimal system efficiency. Linear Characteristic PICV Equal Percentage Characteristic PICV Ductile Iron PICV DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROL VALVE To address the increasing use of variable speed pumps in HVAC applications, we have introduced a range of Differential Pressure Control Valves (DPCV) designed to optimize system performance. The DPCV is set to a maximum differential pressure, ensuring that the flow does not exceed the desired rate, thereby reducing energy consumption, minimizing noise, and simplifying the commissioning process. These valves maintain a constant differential pressure across hydronic systems with variable flow, ensuring the optimal functioning of system components. The DPCV consists of a valve and pressure actuator, and is primarily used in heating and cooling systems to maintain a consistent differential pressure. It ensures the efficient operation of motorized control valves or the entire system/substation, especially when the available differential pressure ratio exceeds 2:1. The valve can also be used for flow limitation in combination with a motorized control valve and is ideally installed in the return line to maintain constant pressure across components. DSR Brass Cast Iron FCU VALVE PACKAGES The flushing bypass kit, featuring a pressure-independent control valve and a Filter ball shut- off valve with an integrated strainer, is designed to maintain design flow rates and provide modulating temperature control. The kit includes isolation valves on both the flow and return lines for efficient system management. The flow valve typically combines an isolation valve and a strainer, while the return valve is integrated into the fixed bypass or a separate valve on the adjustable centre flushing bypass. A flushing bypass and blowdown valve are also included, allowing the valve set and connected terminal unit to be flushed out of the circuit and subsequently forward flushed. This kit offers maximum flexibility, allowing for customization in various configurations. Components can be adjusted, and the centre-to-centre distance of the flushing bypass can be modified to suit specific system requirements. SOLENOID VALVES A solenoid valve is an electromechanical device that uses an electric current to generate a magnetic field, which operates a mechanism to regulate the opening and closing of fluid flow within a valve. These valves vary in terms of the electric current type, magnetic field strength, and fluid control mechanisms, such as linear-action plunger actuators, pivoted- armature actuators, or rocker actuators. Solenoid valves can have two-port designs to regulate flow or multi-port designs to switch flows between multiple ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be integrated into a manifold. Solenoid valves are widely used control elements in fluidic systems, responsible for functions such as shutting off, releasing, dosing, distributing, or mixing fluids. They are favoured for their fast and reliable switching, long service life, good compatibility with different fluids, low control power requirements, and compact design, making them suitable for various applications. Servo - Activated INTELLIGENT CONTROL VALVES Intelligent Control Valves are designed to maintain optimal flow and pressure conditions at all times, ensuring consistent flow, pressure, or levels despite fluctuations in the supply network. These valves help reduce water loss and contribute to efficient water distribution. Integrated with the ACMO PMD communication device, which functions as a local controller, they provide precise control with auto-adaptive PID for various hydraulic conditions. The ACMO PMD offers pre-configurable hydraulic functions, data logging, and real-time communication with flow meters to adjust pressure according to flow, regardless of time. These intelligent control valves have been proven to reduce leakage and burst frequency, providing cost-effective and reliable pressure control. They are essential for smart networks and are widely used in applications such as central air conditioning, water treatment, and heating systems. Integrated with sensor technology, intelligent actuators, and control valves, they offer several benefits for smart network management: Optimized, stable network pressures Pressure and valve position feedback Reaction to system failures Verification of Zones/Pressure Management Areas (PMAs) Adjustment of reservoir flows Reduced leakage Integration with pumps and meters Feedback on water temperature and quality Remote control of storage levels Extended asset life by optimizing maintenance periods Watts intelligent control values RELIEF VALVES A relief valve is a safety device that protects pressurized vessels or systems from overpressure by venting fluid when pressure exceeds the design limits. It ensures safety by preventing catastrophic failure during overpressure events. Unlike other system controls, the valve operates autonomously, using only the process fluid as power, ensuring functionality even during power failures. Designed for reliability, relief valves open at a set pressure, regulate flow during overpressure, and close once normal pressure is restored. Made from materials compatible with various fluids, including corrosive ones, they are used in applications such as hot water heating and domestic boilers to safeguard against excessive pressure. AIR VENTS Air Vents and Vacuum Valves are designed to expel large volumes of air during system start- up and allow air to re-enter the line during system shutdown or failure. When water enters the valve, the float rises to close the discharge port, remaining closed until system pressure drops to near zero psi. The valve does not release air while the system is under pressure. Air Vents provide superior air release capacity compared to similar-sized vents, ensuring reliable operation and reducing water hammer incidents. Constructed from corrosion- resistant, UV-protected reinforced nylon, they feature no metal components to rust or corrode. BTU METER BTU meters are precision instruments used to measure the thermal energy consumption of chilled water in British Thermal Units (BTU), a standard measure of thermal energy for commercial and residential buildings. These meters are essential for billing energy usage in chilled water systems within commercial, industrial, and office buildings. Our BTU meters are designed for high accuracy and reliability.
